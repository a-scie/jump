# Release Process

## Preparation

### Version Bump and Changelog

1. Bump the version in at least [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml) and possibly other crates if they were
   modified.
2. Run `cargo run -p package` to update [`Cargo.lock`](Cargo.lock) with the new version and as a 
   sanity check on the state of the project.
3. Update [`CHANGES.md`](CHANGES.md) with any changes that are likely to be useful to consumers.
4. Open a PR with these changes and land it on https://github.com/a-scie/jump main.
