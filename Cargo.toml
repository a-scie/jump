# N.B.: The `package` psuedo-crate serves as a cross-platform build-step
# to post-process this root crate's binary by adding a 64 bit magic
# trailer to the binary that allows it to know its own size and know if
# it's being run as a stub or an application. This ensures when its
# binary dependency (this root crate) is built, it is size-optimized and
# has symbols stripped. The lto can't be applied to a build script, but
# that is properly plumbed to the root crate during a `-p package`
# build.
